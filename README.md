# Hilton London

In the modern day, public discussion and critiquing of products and services occurs beyond dedicated mediums, and now also takes place in the realm of social media, too.

Potential customers, could have their hotel choice be influenced by a tweet. Opinions are shared constantly on social media platforms, and are read by their followers. The knowledge, of what these followers think about our hotel, from reading these online posts, could help us better understand the general public's perception of our hotel.

By using sentiment analysis, on existing hotel reviews from Tripadvisor.com, I created a model that can quantify on a scale of 1-5, how the author of a tweet on twitter, or a post on a reddit thread, feels about our hotel, and as a result, also how the readers think about us.

## Executive Summary

As a struggling US life insurance company, our goal is to increase revenues by 2% using a risk premium based on premature deaths per state. We aim to hike insurance contract prices across the states that pause the highest future risk of premature death rates. This should in turn take our net premium growth rate above annual inflation which we have been on par with for the last five years and move to a more risk-adjusted business model which is key in our industry.

### Webscraping

I set a goal of a minimum of 5000 reviews to scrape, before choosing the specific hotels. I then chose the 5 Hilton hotels with the highest number of reviews, to scrape; London Gatwick Airport, London Metropole, London Euston, London Croydon, and London - West End. Between these 5 hotels there were 17538 reviews, I had plenty room to filter or drop reviews and retain at least my minimum of 5000.

  <img src="https://github.com/awesomeahi95/Hotel_Review_NLP/blob/master/Images/Tripadvisor_Review_Example.png" width=600>
</p>

The structure of each review consisted of a 1-5 scale score rating in bubble form, a review summary, and a detailed review split into p1 and p2 (depending on if there was a read more option). Each page on tripadvisor had 5 reviews per page, so I had to navigate between pages using tripadvisor's next page function. 

The root URL I used was 'www.tripadvisor.co.uk'

The 5 starting URL extensions I used were:
- '/Hotel_Review-g187051-d239658-Reviews-Hotel_Hilton_London_Gatwick_Airport-Crawley_West_Sussex_England.html/'
- '/Hotel_Review-g186338-d193089-Reviews-Hilton_London_Metropole-London_England.html/'
- '/Hotel_Review-g186338-d192048-Reviews-Hilton_London_Euston-London_England.html/'
- '/Hotel_Review-g186338-d193102-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Hotel_London_West_End-London_England.html/'
- '/Hotel_Review-g504167-d192599-Reviews-Hilton_London_Croydon-Croydon_Greater_London_England.html'

From these pages I chose to extract 5 different features:
- hotel_name
- review_summary
- review_p1
- review_p2
- score

I used a scrapy spider to crawl the website to scrape the requested data. Scrapy proved the be efficient and fast at extracting the data. I ran the spider script (hotels.py) for around 20 minutes, on the 14th May 2020.


<a name="Early_EDA_and_Cleaning"></a>
### Early EDA and Cleaning: 

The dataset we used contained a wide ranging set of health ranking features per county within each state. This included data points such as premature deaths, low birthweight, adult smoking etc. As an intial step, we selected the premature death as our dependent variable, what we aim to predict. This variable is categorized as Years Potential Life Loff (YPLL) - estimate of the average years a person would have lived if he or she had not died prematurely. It is a measure of premature mortality. 

We then decided to exclude columns with confidence interval and quantile to simplify our selection process and model application. In addition, we tested for multicollinearity for the independent variables using a VIF (variance inflation factor) test. It yield some highly collinear relationships across variables that we then excluded. 

We subsequently ran a correlation matrix across all remaining variables and selected 5 variables with some form of positive or negative correlation and plausible causal relationsip with premature deaths. We purposefully kept a wide range of correlation selection as to avoid missing possible related interactions which could help us predict our dependent variable.

Some of our independent variables selected included: Diabetes prevalance raw value, Poor or fair health raw value, and median household income raw value

### Further EDA and Preprocessing

The initial step included setting up a structured framework to the data. We initially setup a train-test split at a 2/3 // 1/3 respective split to include at least 1000 observations in our testing test. For the regularisation models we used StandardScaler to standardise our data.

<a name="Modelling"></a>
### Modelling:

We then performed 5-fold cross validation across our models for our training data to validate the completeness and quality of our data-model interaction. This also allowed us to select the highest performing models within each model group/type. 
The initial baseline model was a multivariate linear regression using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. With 5 different variables the model yielded an R^2 score of 0.5223 which was an encouraging sign as an first instance model.

We then proceeded to perform a polynomial transformation to our variables to factor interactions of independent variables and their explanatory power of premature deaths. We ran three levels of polynomial regression: quadratic, qubic, quartic and quintic. The best results came out of the quadratic transformation with an improved R^2 score of 0.5554. We elected to keep this transformation.  

Using a z-score standard scaler method we took our poly-transformed data and scaled it before applying the regularisation methods. 

To improve our coefficients and simplify our model we decided to run a series of regularisation technqiues using lasso, ridge and elastic net regressions with several alpha levels. In total we had 60 models with regularisation (20 Lasso, 20 Ridge, and 20 Elastic Net). We once again applied the 5-fold validation process to find the best R^2 value across model types with the optimal level.

</p>

Our rationale at this point is to come back to our stakeholders and make sure the regression is as simple as possible to apply it in a business context. We selected a lasso model yielding an R^2 of 0.5241 on the training set with an alpha level of 47.373684. 

Finally, we ran the model on the test set and got an R^2 of 0.5626 illustrating some accuracy in our model and a possibility to deploy it for our business application.

<a name="Evaluation"></a>
### Evaluation

We believe our final model provides us enough prediction accuracy to implement the life insurance premium increase. We are aiming to perform this increase as a function of YPLL predictions scaled to the population size. This model should allow us not only to increase our revenues but to shift towards a more risk-adjusted revenue approach which we can replicate in the future.
