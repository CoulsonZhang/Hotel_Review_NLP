Pros. - Check experience was fine.... The checkin clerk was funny and helpful, and had a lovely manner with the guests. Very efficient. - Location... Very well set for access to Gatwick airport, with a short walk to the terminal for your flights.  Cons - Food...  the hotel not only was packed full and the restaurants were full, but the food itself was incredibly poor and expensive.   We did the buffet... on the evening.... barely anything was truly good tasting..... AVOID - Comfort... Hiltons of late seem to be less and less comfortable, the rooms stark... and without any character. Not the cleanest of rooms either. - its a big hotel.... everywhere is a lengthy walk and"},

So staying at the Gatwick Hilton was a no brainer for our recent departure from south terminal.  Lots of other passengers seem to share this view as we arrived at a busy time.  But we didn\u2019t have to wait long because after checking in on line our key cards had been prepared in advance and given to us whilst in the queue - a great idea.  The hotel has all the usual Hilton brand values - well equipped, spacious rooms, quiet and efficiently run.  We had a nice dinner in Amy\u2019s restaurant which also has a welcoming bar.  All in all a v pleasant hotel that we would be happy to return to."},

As well as booking a room, I booked a Meet and Greet at the hotel for the car, and Ace Parking were there when we arrived to take the car away for the duration of our holiday.  This is such an easy way to combine a room and parking.  The hotel has 821 rooms, spread over six floors. There are eleven different types of room, so there is plenty of choice depending on your budget. I chose a twin guest room, but when booking in online, I was offered a deluxe twin room which I was happy to take.  We occupied Room 7012, that has an interconnecting door to the room next door if you require a family room. The level of decoration in the room was very good, and it also had a free security safe,"},

The gentleman turned out to Mohamed who worked on the priorty desk, who in fact couldnt do enough for us , even gave us a recently refurbished room. Room was bright and spotless, tea and coffee facility , bed was comfortable , lots of extras in the shower room, what more could we wish for . Considering the money we paid this was a good start to our holiday. With a 5/6 minute walk to the terminal it didnt get any better. We skipped  the \u00a318 pp breakfast as we felt we couldnt do it justice. Bar prices once the discretionary  service charge was added were a little on the high side .But its London,"},
{"score": "<span class=\"ui_bubble_rating bubble_40\"></span>", "review": "We had an executive room and even these are starting to look a bit old and tired. That said still a very nice room.    We had a problem in that literally every time we moved the bed frame creaked really loudly, so we both had a rubbish nights sleep as every time one of us moved it woke us up.  I mentioned it at checkout and got the impression of little interest and it probably hasn\u2019t been dealt with,  with all he said being \u201coh, we\u2019ll look into it\u201d   The above said there does appear to be some building work going on so hopefully this is a modernisation programme, as we love staying at this hotel."},
